#mountain_render

This is a small project to test out 3D rendering using rasterisation. Objects are transformed in a mesh composed of triangles which are then transformed and projected on the screen. Display is with ggez v0.5.1.

3 different commands, for cube: cube 
For sphere: sphere [1-3:number of subdivisions of icosahedron]
For mountain: mountain [1-50: number of subdivisions of triangles (more is laggier)] [0.0-10.0: height coefficient, smaller is higher mountains near center] 
Q/E for x rotation, Left/Right for y rotation and Up/Down for z rotation. WASD and Shift/Ctrl to move object around
